# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`, `npm run server`, and then `npm start`

## Context

This app was developed for a course project. It could be used in a context for registering technical support interactions, saving messages to the API. Each message contains an id, a channel through which it came, the trigger/reason the message was sent, time it took to deal with, and the message itself. The goal was to challenge students in:
<li> Form validations with Yup. </li>
<li> Dashboard development with Chart.js. </li>
<li> Responsive app design, using CSS media queries. </li>
<li> API calls (GET, POST, and DELETE). </li>
<li> Sweetalert 2 modals. </li>
